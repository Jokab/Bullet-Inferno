##Game goal
The goal Bullet Inferno is simply to get as high of a score as possible. You can score by simply staying alive, but also by killing enemies and defeating bosses.

##Loadout menu
Here you have a chance to customize your game experience. Selecting the different equipment can drastically alter your performance.

###Standard weapon
Standard weapons fire automatically, all the time. They are weaker than the heavy weapon, but you don't have to worry about firing them at the right time.

###Heavy weapon
Heavy weapons fire when you touch the right half of the screen. These weapons have a cooldown, which means that once you fire all the projectiles in your ammo clip, it will deplete and start recharging slowly. Therefore, you need to save them for when you need them the most!

###Special ability
Special abilities provide an extra attack that can be used by touching the special ability button in the bottom-right of the screen. Currently implemented are:
[*] Nuke: Damages all enemies on the screen.
[*] Projectile rain: Spawns 20 projectiles evenly across the y-axis, but at random positions and at an interval. Incredibly useful if you're facing a lot of enemies.

###Passive ability
Passive abilities give you a permanent boost throughout the game without having to be activated. Currently implemented are:
[*] Reload time: Lowers the reloading time of your primary weapon, essentially making it shoot faster.
[*] Shield: Makes you take less damage.
[*] Damage: Makes you deal more damage.

##Gameplay

###Movement
You move by touching and dragging your finger on the left half of the screen. You can only move up and down, while travelling at a constant speed to the right.

###Shooting
Your standard weapons fires automatically. Your heavy weapon fires when you press the right half of the screen.

###Activating special ability
Special abilies are activated by pressing the special ability button in the bottom-right.

###Enemies
Enemies try to shoot at you, so avoid both their shots and crashing into them at all costs, because both deal significant damage. Killing an enemy gives you 20 score.

###Bosses
Bosses are mega-enemies, and are very difficult to defeat. However, they also give a massive amount of points.

###Score
Simply staying alive and progressing through the level gives you score, but killing enemies and defeating bosses also give you score.

###Crashing
Crashing into the terrain instantly kills you. The weapons that are attached to you are not part of your ship, so they don't take damage from enemies and the they don't crash into the terrain.

###Regenerating health
Your health constantly regenerates, so that you have a chance of coming back from a mistake.

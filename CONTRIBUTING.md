## Bug Reports
If you think you have found a bug, please open a new [issue] and try to
answer the following questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What happened instead?

Make sure to specify which version (or revision) you are using, the android version and.

## Feature Requests
If you have a great feature you would like to see added to Bullet-Inferno, by all means open a new 
[issue] and make a feature request. However, it is far more likely that your feature will be 
integrated if you submit an actual working pull request!


## Pull Requests

As a first step, please make sure you first read up on our [development documentation], and follow 
guidelines outlined in it.

- **Add JUnit tests!** If at all applicable, please add JUnit test for your added features and make 
sure the entire test suite passes before sending your pull request. Pull requests breaking or not 
passing tests will not be accepted.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, make
  multiple pull requests.

- **Squash any unnecessary commits**. Make sure each commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash (see for example http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) them before sending the pull request.
